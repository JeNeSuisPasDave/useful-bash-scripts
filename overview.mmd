## Introduction [ubsintro]

This Git repository contains bash scripts that I found useful on my OS X system.

Each sub-directory contains one or more scripts and supporting files focus on a certain task or set of related tasks.

## backup-pinboard [ubsbkuppb]l

This script makes a copy of my [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) bookmarks. It is intended to scheduled daily or weekly, and maintains a rolling list of older backups.

There is an installer that inserts the Pinboard username and password, and sets file permissions to make sure that only your account can read the file.
